Task 1 

Create a simple text based hangman game whrere the players gusses a word one letter at a time. 
Use a small list of 5 predefined words (no need to use a file or API).
● Limit incorrect guesses to 6.
● Basic console input/output — no graphics or audio.
Key Concepts Used: random, while loop, if-else, strings, lists.

Solution

import random

# List of predefined words
word_list = ["apple", "train", "plant", "bread", "house"]

# Select a random word from the list
secret_word = random.choice(word_list)

# Create display with underscores for each letter
display = [""] * len(secret_word)

# Track wrong guesses and attempts
wrong_guesses = 0
max_attempts = 6
guessed_letters = []

print("Welcome to Hangman!")
print("Guess the word, one letter at a time.")
print("You can make 6 incorrect guesses.\n")

# Game loop
while wrong_guesses < max_attempts and "_" in display:
    print("Word:", " ".join(display))
    guess = input("Enter a letter: ").lower()

    # Input validation
    if not guess.isalpha() or len(guess) != 1:
        print("Enter a single alphabet letter.\n")
        continue
    if guess in guessed_letters:
        print("You already guessed that letter.\n")
        continue

    guessed_letters.append(guess)

    if guess in secret_word:
        print("Correct guess!\n")
        for i in range(len(secret_word)):
            if secret_word[i] == guess:
                display[i] = guess
    else:
        wrong_guesses += 1
        print(f"Wrong guess! Attempts left: {max_attempts - wrong_guesses}\n")

# Final result
if "_" not in display:
    print("You won! The word was:", secret_word)
else:
    print("Game Over! The word was:", secret_word)
