TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker

Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stockprices.

â€¢ Simplified Scope:
User inputs stock names and quantity.
Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 258}).o 
Display total investment value and optionally save the result in a.txt or.csv file. 
Key Concepts Used: dictionary, input/output, basic arithmetic, file handling(optional).

Solution
 
# Hardcoded stock prices
stock_prices = {
    "AAPL": 180,
    "TSLA": 258,
    "GOOGL": 135,
    "AMZN": 125,
    "MSFT": 310
}

# Dictionary to store user input (stock name and quantity)
portfolio = {}

print("ðŸ“ˆ Welcome to the Stock Portfolio Tracker!")
print("Available stocks:", ", ".join(stock_prices.keys()))
print("Feel free to enter stock names and quantities. Just type 'done' when you're finished.\n")

# User input loop
while True:
    stock = input("Please enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL): ").upper()
    if stock == 'DONE':
        break
    if stock not in stock_prices:
        print(" Oops! Stock not found. Please try again.")
        continue

    try:
        quantity = int(input(f"How many shares of {stock} would you like to buy? "))
        if quantity <= 0:
            print(" Quantity must be a positive number.")
            continue
        portfolio[stock] = portfolio.get(stock, 0) + quantity
    except ValueError:
        print(" Please enter a valid number.")

# Calculate total investment
total_value = 0
print("\nHereâ€™s your Portfolio Summary:")
for stock, qty in portfolio.items():
    price = stock_prices[stock]
    value = price * qty
    total_value += value
    print(f"{stock}: {qty} shares Ã— ${price} = ${value}")

print(f"\n Your Total Investment Value: ${total_value}")

# Optional: Save to file
save = input("\nWould you like to save this summary to a file? (yes/no): ").lower()
if save == "yes":
    with open("portfolio_summary.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("Stock Portfolio Summary\n")
        file.write("------------------------\n")
        for stock, qty in portfolio.items():
            price = stock_prices[stock]
            value = price * qty
            file.write(f"{stock}: {qty} shares Ã— ${price} = ${value}\n")
